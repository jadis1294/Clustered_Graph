# Clustered_Graph
A drawing Γ(C) of a c-graph C(G, T) is a mapping of vertices and edges
of G to points and to Jordan curves joining their incident vertices, respectively,
and of each internal node μ of T to a simple closed region R(μ) containing
exactly the vertices of μ. Drawing Γ(C) is c-planar if: (i) curves representing
edges of G do not intersect except at common end-points; (ii) the boundaries of
the regions representing clusters do not intersect; and (iii) each edge intersects
the boundary of a region at most one time. A c-graph is c-planar if it admits a
c-planar drawing.
